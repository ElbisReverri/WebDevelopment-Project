		 Chrollo Lucilfer has regained access to his nen after Kurapika was tricked into breaking his oath 
	<br> to never use his chains on a non member of the Phantom Troupe, causing his untimely demise. 
	<br> Mourning the loss of his dear friend Leorio is not fit to battle the notorious Phantom Troupe 
	<br> as they seek to kill all those who opposed their leader. Gon is still recovering from his battle 
	<br> with Neferpitou while Ging is has left due to the Chairman elections. Defeating the Phantom Troupe 
	<br>is up to the unlikely duo Killua and Hisoka. Killua seeks blood to avenge Kurapika, while Hisoka 
	<br> seeks satisfaction, since he never got his chance to battle the great Chrollo Lucilfer.

		<h2> Rules Of The Game </h2>
<ol>
	<li>Every choice you make is crucial!</li>
		<br>
	<p2>Understand that every choice you make will 
		<br>lead to another conclusion, it is possible 
		<br>to die and if that time comes you must start 
		<br>from the beginning and make wiser decisions.
		<br>
	</p2>
		<br>
		<li>Understand Your Hunter's Strengths and Weaknesses!</li>
		<br>
	<p2> Hisoka and Killua have two very different drives and fighting 
		<br> styles. Along with that the two think very differently. 
		<br> Killua will more likely analyze a situation and figure 
		<br> out the best possible outcome that involves the least amount 
		<br> of damage, while Hisoka may jump head first into the action 
		<br> leaving you with possibly less options of exploration but likely more combat. 
		<br><b> Keep these facts in mind when choosing a hunter/playstyle.</b>
