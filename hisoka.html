			<p>Hisoka Marow is a world class fighter with cunning wits and an undeniable charm. 
			<br>He can talk his way out of any situation, but why would he do that when he can 
			<br>just as well kill his way out. He is aimed to take up conflict in just about every situation as long as it
			<br>benefits him positively. Do you choose the hardened assassin with no moral compass?
